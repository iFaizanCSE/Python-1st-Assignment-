        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data1 (attributes) and code (methods). It focuses on organizing code around these objects, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have. For example, a \"Car\"2 class might define attributes like \"color,\" \"model,\" and \"speed,\" and methods like \"accelerate,\" \"brake,\" and \"turn.\"\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete representation of the class, with specific values for the attributes defined in the class. For example, a specific car like a \"red Ferrari\" would be an object of the \"Car\" class.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - - Abstraction: It's the process of simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features and hiding unnecessary details. For example, you don't need to know the internal workings of a car engine to drive it.\n",
        "\t - Encapsulation: It's the mechanism of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class). This protects the data from unauthorized access and modification.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). They allow you to define how objects of your class behave in specific situations. For example, __init__ is the constructor, used to initialize objects.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (the subclass or derived class) inherits the properties and methods of another class (the superclass or base class).3 This promotes code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchy of classes.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In OOP, it refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This allows you to write code that can work with objects of various classes in a uniform way.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using the concept of access modifiers. By default, all attributes and methods in a class are public. However, you can make them private by prefixing them with a double underscore (__). This prevents direct access from outside the class.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - The constructor is a special method in Python called __init__. It's automatically called when an object of the class is created. It's used to initialize the object's attributes with initial values.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  -   - Class methods: Bound to the class, not the object. They can access and modify class-level attributes. Decorated with @classmethod.\n",
        "      - Static methods: Not bound to the class or object. They are simply functions that are logically related to the class. Decorated with @staticmethod.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Python doesn't directly support method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). However, you can achieve similar functionality using default arguments and variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a different implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to customize the behavior4 of the inherited method.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - The @property decorator allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes. This helps to encapsulate data and provide more control over how attributes are accessed and modified.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism makes code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain. It allows you to write generic code that can work with objects of different classes, making your programs more adaptable to changes.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a template for other classes and often contains abstract methods (methods without implementation).\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  -  - Modularity: Code is organized into reusable objects, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
        "     - Reusability: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from existing classes.\n",
        "     - Flexibility: Polymorphism enables you to write code that can work with\n",
        "       objects of different classes.\n",
        "     - Maintainability: Changes to one part of the system are less likely to affect other parts.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  -  - Class variable: Belongs to the class itself, not to individual objects. Shared by all instances of the class.\n",
        "  -  -\tInstance variable: Belongs to a specific object of the class. Each object has its own copy of instance variables.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit from multiple parent classes. This allows you to combine the features of multiple classes into a single class.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "  -   - __str__: Returns a user-friendly string representation of the object.\n",
        "      - __repr__: Returns a string representation that can be used to recreate the object. It's often more technical and intended for developers.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function allows you to call methods of the parent class from within a child class. This is useful for overriding methods while still using the parent class's implementation.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method, also known as the destructor, is called when an object is about to be garbage collected. It can be used to perform cleanup tasks before the object is destroyed.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  -  - @staticmethod: Decorates a method that is not bound to the class or object. It's simply a function that is logically related to the class.\n",
        "  -  -\t@classmethod: Decorates a method that is bound to the class, not the object. It can access and modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python works through method overriding. When you call a method on an object, the Python interpreter first looks for that method in the object's class. If it's not found, it searches the parent classes in the inheritance hierarchy. This allows you to treat objects of different classes in a uniform way.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining allows you to call multiple methods on an object in a single line of code. Each method returns the object itself, allowing you to chain calls together.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __call__ method allows you to make objects of your class callable, like functions. When you use parentheses () after an object that has __call__ defined, this method is invoked.\n",
